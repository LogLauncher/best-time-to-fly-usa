## Study design

The data was collected by going to the respective sites and downloading the csv that was provided.

## Instruction list

The following section will walk you through different steps you will need to take to get the data from `raw` to `processed`.

### 1\. Getting the files

Most file are in this GitHub repository but some where to big and are located in the school share folder (COMMUN).<br>

1. Download or clone the Git repository.
2. Go to the following location `N:\COMMUN\ELEVE\INFO\SI-T2a\BI1\Struan_Forsyth\raw_data` and copy the file into the `raw` folder.

### 2\. Executing the scripts / Copying files

To execute the scripts you will need to have **Ruby** installed.

- [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/][f1e3ba67]

Once you have ruby installed open a command prompt, navigate to the `scripts` folder and run the following two scripts:

- `$ ruby clean_flights.rb`
- `$ ruby clean_storm.rb`

While the scripts are executing you can copy the following files from the `raw` folder to the `processed` folder.

- `states.csv`
- `airports.csv`

### 3\. Manual cleanup

Once all the scripts are finished and you have the 6 files in the `processed` folder, open them up in a text editor (**WARNING** some files contain a lot of data and might crash certain text editors (Cough...Atom). I personally recommend **Notepad++** as it is the one I used and it worked fine).<br>
In all the file that have them, remove the **Header**, then save and close the file.

### 4\. Import into MySQL database (wamp/phpMyAdmin)

In the scripts folder you'll find a **sql** file to create the database with the tables you'll need for importing the files.<br>
Create the database on your server and then proceed to import the different files into the correct tables.

In phpMyAdmin when importing the **flight** csv files, I would get a timeout. Luckily, phpMyAdmin allows you to resume importing from where you left off.<br>
When resuming an import remove from the URL the following part `&timeout_passed=1`. This helped me out with it crashing on the resumed import.

Once every thing is imported you will need to run the following query in your database:

Description: Gets all the possible date and state abbreviation from the storms and flights tables. It then inserts the result into a date_state table with a unique `id`.

```sql
INSERT INTO date_state
(SELECT (@cnt := @cnt + 1) AS id, b.*
FROM
(SELECT * FROM
((SELECT f.departure_date AS `date`, a.state_abbr FROM flights f
INNER JOIN airports a ON
a.iata = f.origin
WHERE (f.arr_delay + f.dep_delay) > 0
GROUP BY f.departure_date, a.state_abbr)
UNION
(SELECT f.departure_date AS `date`, a.state_abbr FROM flights f
INNER JOIN airports a ON
a.iata = f.dest
WHERE (f.arr_delay + f.dep_delay) > 0
GROUP BY f.departure_date, a.state_abbr)
UNION
(SELECT DISTINCT start_date AS `date`, state_abbr
FROM storms)
UNION
(SELECT DISTINCT end_date AS `date`, state_abbr
FROM storms)) t
GROUP BY `date`, state_abbr
ORDER BY `date`, state_abbr) b
CROSS JOIN (SELECT @cnt := 0) AS d);
```

Description: Gets all the flights with a delay and replaces the `date` with a date_state `id`. It then inserts the result into a flights_only_delay table.

```sql
INSERT INTO flights_only_delay
SELECT * FROM
((SELECT ds.id AS `fk_date_state`, f.arr_delay, f.dep_delay, f.origin, f.dest, f.weather_delay
FROM flights f
INNER JOIN airports a ON
a.iata = f.origin
INNER JOIN date_state ds ON
ds.`date` = f.departure_date AND ds.state_abbr = a.state_abbr
WHERE (f.arr_delay + f.dep_delay) > 0)
UNION
(SELECT ds.id AS `fk_date_state`, f.arr_delay, f.dep_delay, f.origin, f.dest, f.weather_delay
FROM flights f
INNER JOIN airports a ON
a.iata = f.dest
INNER JOIN date_state ds ON
ds.`date` = f.departure_date AND ds.state_abbr = a.state_abbr
WHERE (f.arr_delay + f.dep_delay) > 0)) a
```

### 5\. Importing into PowerBI

When selecting the type of data to import into the software, select **MySQL** and link to your database.<br>
When selecting the server and database name you'll need to selection **Advanced Options** (Option avanc√©e) to be able to add a SQL query to load data.

There are three table you'll need to import:

- date_state
- flights_only_delay
- storms

You'll need to import the `storms` by it's self and add the following SQL query:<br>

Description: Adds the date_state `id` to the storms table. What is returned is `id` (id in date_state table) and `type` (type of storm)

```sql
(SELECT ds.id AS `fk_date_state`, s.type
FROM storms s
INNER JOIN date_state ds ON
ds.`date` = s.start_date AND ds.state_abbr = s.state_abbr)
UNION ALL
(SELECT ds.id AS `fk_date_state`, s.type
FROM storms s
INNER JOIN date_state ds ON
ds.`date` = s.end_date AND ds.state_abbr = s.state_abbr
WHERE s.start_date != s.end_date)
```

## Code book CSV files

The code book is for the cleaned data.<br>
The headers where removed so they could be imported into a MySQL server (wamp/phpMyAdmin, in my case).
